                        It is time to declutter and make a little extra money from it.  TOSSPI is the place to sell these items at.

                        Our goal here at TOSSPI is to help all of us declutter our homes, closets, basements, garages, storage units, etc. We give you a place to sell these items by connecting you with millions and millions of potential customers world wide.

                        Why not decide to sell these various items and put a little cash back into our bank accounts or wallets.  Let someone else enjoy these items that you have stashed away and no longer use.  

                        Say "Goodbye" to the things that are just sitting around and collecting dust and turn them into money in your pocket.  I guarantee someone else is looking for whatever you decide you want to get rid of.

                        People buy all kinds of things:  broken things that they want to fix as it is thier hobby. Maybe their budget is not very high and the item you are offering is just what they are looking for and is within thier budget.  There are so many reasons why people sell and purchase things.  We all do it.  Yes, each and everyone of us do this at various times.
